//time complexity : the instructions taken by the program to run the program 
//space complexity: the memory consumed by the program 

//we can easily count the space complexity of the program : 39 variables used here array elements are included 
//but time complexity varies in different manner in which which system you are using how much threads you have how much RAM you have , how much time you are using the memory etc. 



// Algorithm complexity 
// Algorithm means the steps to do  something 


//while using the algorithm we check the two things 
//time complexity 
//space complexity
