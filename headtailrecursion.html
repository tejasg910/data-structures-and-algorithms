        //let me explain the call stack in simple example 
        //call stack is a memory of the javascript engine which stores the functions during calls 
        //for example you have declared a function it will not added in the called stack but as you run or execute that function it will be fired and added to the call stack and it will not removed from call stack until function completes 

        //in this scenario we are calling function inside a function by third function 
        //so the functions will be added to the call stack until it finishes the execution 

        //now you have a assessment you need to explain the code that i have written below 

        function call(x){
            console.log(x) //head recursion 

            
            //head recursion calls immediately after the function call 

            if(x>0){
                call(x-1) 
            }

            console.log(x)  //tail recursion 
         
            //but tail recursion calls at the time of ending of all functions 
         

            
        }

       const res =  call(5)
       console.log(res)
